# 🌍 Open-Source Plastic Shredder for 3D Printing Waste

**A modular, self-fabricated shredder designed for labs, makerspaces, and classrooms around the world. Built with affordable materials and hobby-grade tools, this project supports circularity, sustainability, and accessible engineering.**

## 🔧 About the Project

As 3D printing becomes more widespread, so does its waste—failed prints, supports, and excess prototypes. This open-source shredder enables small-scale recycling of that plastic into material suitable for extrusion into new filament.

Our design prioritizes:
- 🛠️ **Making** – We emphasize fabrication, not just CAD.
- 🌍 **Accessibility** – Built from globally available tools and materials.
- ♻️ **Sustainability** – Aligned with UN SDG 12 for circular production.

All files, documentation, and build guides are included to help you fabricate and adapt the shredder in your own lab or makerspace.

## 🧰 What You'll Need

**Tools:**
- Laser cutter
- FDM 3D printer (e.g., Prusa, Creality)
- CNC router (optional for motor mount)
- Basic hand tools and soldering equipment

**Materials:**
- MDF wood (6mm / 16mm)
- PLA, ABS, or PC+ filament
- Bearings (608ZZ, 6002 2RS, etc.)
- Bolts and nuts (M3–M6)
- Gear motor (~\$40, or cheaper alternatives)

Full details in the [manual](Manual.pdf).

## 🔄 How It Works

1. Print your model
2. Shred failed or excess prints into pellets
3. Extrude into new filament
4. Repeat 🌀

## 🧪 Tested and Improved

The shredder underwent multiple iterations:
- **Axle upgrades** from PLA to ABS for added strength
- **Gearbox stress-tested**, PC+ used for heat resistance
- Modular design adapted to user feedback

See full details in the [System Evaluation](report.pdf).
